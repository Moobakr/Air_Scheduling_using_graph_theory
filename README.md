Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest and most efficient paths for airplanes. By representing airports as nodes and flight routes as edges with associated weights (such as distance or travel time), we construct a graph model of the air network. Dijkstra's algorithm, renowned for its efficiency in finding the shortest path in weighted graphs, is employed to compute optimal routes. This approach not only minimizes travel time and fuel consumption but also enhances overall scheduling efficiency and resource allocation.
